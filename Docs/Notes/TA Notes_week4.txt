Meeting Notes

docs should be in main (merge in main)

link on mattermost: import classes from different microservices

only add a class for requests if there are a lot of methods that might send requests


use chain of responsability with more than one check


for true or false checks, use HTTP codes, do not create any classes

pass data using DTOs

do not share databases between microservices


each microservice has the same API structure


upload the assignment on gitlab. 
tag the commit for the design patterns (link from TA)
the rubric for the assignment is released this week, so have a look at that
the feedback of the TA is based on the rubric, so follow all TA advice
all code should be finished until 24th 
all the design patterns should be done by 16th


unit testing, integration testing, functional testing (explain in text) (not mandatory at the moment)

push the code to main more often (twice a week)
use the gitlab boards
have a working demo for each of the week
